# Fix typography

I'm not an English native speaker so you can help by fixing the typography in Wiki, README.md or even my comments under `funceble` and `tool`!

If you plan to fix typography into `funceble` and or `tool` please be sure to read the [:warning: WARNING :warning:](https://github.com/funilrys/funceble/wiki/How-to-contribute%3F/#warning-warning-warning) part first.

# Suggest new Features

I like to get suggestion about things I didn't think about! So let me know your suggestion if it's possible and once it's implemented your name/nickname will be added in the [Special Thanks and Contributors](https://github.com/funilrys/funceble/wiki/Special-Thanks-and-Contributors) section! :smile:
